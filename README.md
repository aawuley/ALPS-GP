The ALPS[Hornby,2006] strategy is a diversity–enhancing algorithm that works with algorithms 
with elements of randomness in them . It uses an age–layered population and restricts breeding 
and competition between individuals. ALPS ability to maintain diversity in its population is largely 
due to regular introduction of individuals from different fitness basins and the novel control of 
competition between individuals. 

The implementation is based on the open source Evolutionary Computation system in Java
developed by Sean Luke [ECJ,V22]
This was done using version 22 of the ECJ system.
