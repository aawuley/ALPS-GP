The ALPS[Hornby,2006] strategy is a diversity–enhancing algorithm that works with algorithms 
with elements of randomness in them [29]. It uses an age–layered population and restricts breeding 
and competition between individuals. ALPS ability to main- tain diversity in its population is largely 
due to regular introduction of individuals from different fitness basins and the novel control of 
competition between individuals
